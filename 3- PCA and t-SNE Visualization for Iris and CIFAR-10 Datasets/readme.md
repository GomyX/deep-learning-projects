# PCA and t-SNE Visualization for Iris and CIFAR-10 Datasets
This project aims to explore and visualize the Iris and CIFAR-10 datasets using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). By reducing the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space, we can gain insights into the structure and patterns present in the datasets.

## Dataset
**Iris Dataset**: The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that contains measurements of four features from three different species of Iris flowers. It is commonly used for classification tasks. The dataset is available in many machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn.

**CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images belonging to ten different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for image classification tasks. The dataset can be obtained from the official CIFAR-10 website or through machine learning libraries.


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the datasets, apply dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE, and visualize the results.
* Experiment with different hyperparameters, visualization techniques, or preprocessing steps to gain further insights into the datasets.
