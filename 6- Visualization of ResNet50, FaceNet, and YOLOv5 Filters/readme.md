# Visualizing Filters in ResNet50, FaceNet, and YOLOv5
This repository provides code and examples for visualizing the filters in three popular deep learning models: ResNet50, FaceNet, and YOLOv5. By visualizing the filters, we can gain insights into what each filter learns and how it contributes to the model's performance in various tasks.

## Models
**ResNet50**: ResNet50 is a widely used deep convolutional neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various computer vision tasks, including image classification. It consists of 50 layers and is known for its skip connections, which enable the model to learn effectively even with deeper architectures.

**FaceNet**: FaceNet is a deep learning model specifically designed for face recognition tasks. It employs a deep convolutional neural network to learn a compact representation of faces in an embedding space, where the distances between embeddings can be used to measure similarity between faces.

**YOLOv5**: YOLOv5 is a popular object detection model that achieves high accuracy and real-time performance. It uses a deep convolutional neural network to detect and classify objects in images. The model is known for its efficient architecture and accurate bounding box predictions.
