# YOLO Versions Comparison on Video
## Project Description:
This project aims to implement and compare different versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once) on a video to detect and track objects. YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its real-time performance and accuracy. By implementing and evaluating multiple versions of YOLO on a video, we can assess their detection capabilities and speed, enabling us to make informed decisions based on specific requirements and constraints.

## Features:
Object Detection and Tracking:

Utilize YOLO versions (e.g., YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4) to detect objects in a video.
Detect and track objects in each frame, providing bounding box coordinates and class labels.
**Video Processing**:

Input a video file or stream and process each frame for object detection.
Extract frames from the video and apply the chosen YOLO version to detect objects.
**Output Visualization**:

Annotate the detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
Generate a new video with the annotated objects to visualize the detection results.
**Performance Metrics**:

Measure the speed of each YOLO version during object detection on the video.
Calculate the average frames per second (FPS) for each YOLO version.
**Comparison and Evaluation**:

Compare the detection accuracy of different YOLO versions by examining the annotated videos.
Assess the trade-off between accuracy and speed for each YOLO version.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each version in terms of object detection in videos.
