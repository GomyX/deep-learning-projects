# USPS Autoencoder
This project aims to implement an autoencoder on the USPS dataset and visualize three important cases: the original images, the intermediate layer representations, and the reconstructed images. An autoencoder is a neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning, where the model learns to encode the input data into a compressed representation and then reconstructs it back to the original form. By visualizing these cases, we can gain insights into the learned representations and the performance of the autoencoder.

## Dataset
The USPS dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, similar to the well-known MNIST dataset. Each image is 16x16 pixels in size, and there are 10 classes representing the digits 0 to 9. This dataset is commonly used for tasks such as digit recognition and classification.
**data:** This notebook uses the built-in USPS dataset.
