# Face Recognition System with FaceNet
## Project Description:
The Face Recognition System with FaceNet project aims to develop a robust facial recognition system using the FaceNet model. The system will be trained on a dataset consisting of personal photos and images of celebrities. FaceNet is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that extracts high-dimensional facial embeddings, enabling accurate face recognition and verification tasks.

## Features:
**Data Collection:**

Gather a dataset of personal photos for training the FaceNet model.
Collect images of celebrities to create a diverse and representative dataset.
**Face Detection and Alignment:**

Utilize a face detection algorithm to detect and extract faces from images.
Perform face alignment to normalize the facial appearance and improve recognition accuracy.
**Face Embedding Extraction:**

Train the FaceNet model using the collected dataset to extract high-dimensional facial embeddings.
Facial embeddings capture unique facial features and represent faces as numerical vectors.
**Face Recognition and Verification:**

Implement face recognition functionality to identify and verify individuals.
Compare facial embeddings to determine if two faces belong to the same person or not.

**Recognition and Verification Process:**
Capture or input an image containing a face to be recognized or verified.
Apply face detection and alignment to extract the face.
Extract the facial embedding using the trained FaceNet model.
Compare the extracted embedding with the embeddings in the database for recognition or verification.
**Accuracy Assessment:**

Evaluate the accuracy of the face recognition system using validation or test datasets.
Measure metrics such as accuracy score to assess performance.
